Project was developed with starter code. This is an API for a social network web application , where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Basically the full back end of a social media app. It uses Mongo and mongoose as its database storage, and uses express as its router for all endpoints. While all programmed using Node.js to tie it all in, its been interesting, and has shown me how social media apps can work conceptually. Getting all the endpoints to work with Mongo and mongoose, made me understand how routing properly works, and how the schemas(models) work as well in relation to MySql. Another step in the direction of completeing the whole stack. 

### How to Test Properly and Easily

This program was tested through [Insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/) for all its endpoints. Ive included the routes I tested in Insomnia, as a JSON file. (something probably not alot of people have included in their projects) You can import that file into your endpoint tester, or through Insomnia. IF you dont know how to do that, then [click here](docs.insomnia.rest).

***
## Installation

***
If you are positioned on your root directory, then from
the command line, type and run the following commands

    `npm i`   

Thats it.


This 'npm i' should install all the packages below, check the package.json
file if its not installed see if they are even listed as a dependency,
and if these files are not listed, these commands below will
install them and give you an updated version.

    `npm install express`

    `npm install Mongoose`

    *Optional* : dotenv (if you plan to run this progam on a remote server)

*Note: Node package manager must be installed on your computer in order for these commands to work with the CLI.* 

*<a href = "https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm"> Click here to download npm , which gives you the ability to publish and install the dependencies for this application.</a>*

***
## Usage

***

The only way this can work if you have MongoDB installed on your machine. If not check out the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/)

Then after that is installed, run this command on your CLI

    `npm i `

This command installs all of the dependencies. Feel free to add more , what ever suits your savvy. (idk what that means)

to get the server started, run the following commands at root

    `npm run start`

## Integration/Deploy Links

### Demo

This walkthrough video shows ALL endpoints being tested in Insomnia. No music this time , havent gotten used to Adobe Premier yet. I got a youtube copyright strike last time for the music. Bleh

[Here is the youtube video of the Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYOAAL03Eo8)

If you want to test it, just like I have, refer to the [How to Test Properly and Easily](#how-to-test-properly-and-easily) section.

## Future Plans + Questions

***

My plans for after the project?

    "Go back over it as reference for anything that has to do with MongoDB and mongoose. To be honest this is just the backend, i want to see how it works
    with the front end fully fleshed out. i Might have to spend some time doing that once i finish this Full stack program."
